## Before/After: Why This Pattern Matters

**Your task:** Compare naive vs optimized storage approaches to understand the trade-offs.

### Example: Write-Heavy Workload

**Problem:** Insert 10,000 key-value pairs as quickly as possible.

#### Approach 1: B+Tree (Immediate Persistence)

```java
// Every write requires tree traversal and potential rebalancing
BPlusTree<Integer, String> btree = new BPlusTree<>(128);

long start = System.nanoTime();
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    btree.insert(i, "Value" + i);  // Each insert: O(log N)
    // Must traverse tree from root to leaf
    // May trigger node splits (expensive)
    // Must maintain tree balance property
}
long duration = System.nanoTime() - start;
```

**Analysis:**

- Time: O(N log N) - Each insert is O(log N)
- Space: O(N) - Tree structure overhead
- For 10,000 inserts: ~10,000 * log(10,000) = ~130,000 operations
- Write amplification: High (each insert may split nodes, update parent pointers)

#### Approach 2: LSM Tree (Buffered Writes)

```java
// Writes go to in-memory MemTable (just a TreeMap insert)
LSMTree<Integer, String> lsm = new LSMTree<>(100);

long start = System.nanoTime();
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
    lsm.put(i, "Value" + i);  // Each put: O(log M), M = memTable size
    // Only updates in-memory TreeMap
    // Occasional flush to disk (batched)
}
long duration = System.nanoTime() - start;
```

**Analysis:**

- Time: O(N log M) where M << N (M = MemTable size)
- Space: O(N) - Eventually flushes to SSTables
- For 10,000 inserts: ~10,000 * log(100) = ~20,000 operations
- Write amplification: Lower (batch writes to disk)

#### Performance Comparison

| Operation Count | B+Tree (O(N log N)) | LSM Tree (O(N log M)) | LSM Advantage |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
| N = 1,000       | ~10,000 ops         | ~2,000 ops            | 5x faster     |
| N = 10,000      | ~130,000 ops        | ~20,000 ops           | 6.5x faster   |
| N = 100,000     | ~1,700,000 ops      | ~200,000 ops          | 8.5x faster   |

**Your calculation:** For N = 50,000 writes, LSM Tree is approximately _____ times faster.

#### Why Does LSM Win for Writes?

**Key insight to understand:**

B+Tree: Every insert = tree traversal + potential split

```
Insert key=50:

1. Traverse root → internal → leaf (3 disk seeks)
2. Insert in leaf (sorted position)
3. If leaf full, split node (expensive)
4. Update parent pointers (more writes)
Result: 1 logical write = 4-5 physical writes (write amplification!)
```

LSM Tree: Batched sequential writes

```
Insert key=50:

1. Insert into MemTable (in-memory TreeMap)
2. When MemTable full, flush entire batch to SSTable
3. Sequential write to disk (very fast)
Result: 1 logical write = 1 in-memory write (occasionally batched to disk)
```

### Example: Read-Heavy Workload

**Problem:** Perform 1,000 random lookups after loading 10,000 records.

#### Approach 1: B+Tree (Single Location Read)

```java
BPlusTree<Integer, String> btree = new BPlusTree<>(128);
// Load data...

long start = System.nanoTime();
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    int key = random.nextInt(10000);
    String value = btree.search(key);  // Single tree traversal: O(log N)
    // Root → Internal → Leaf (3-4 hops)
}
long duration = System.nanoTime() - start;
```

**Analysis:**

- Time: O(log N) per read
- For 1,000 reads: ~1,000 * log(10,000) = ~13,000 operations
- Read amplification: Low (single path through tree)

#### Approach 2: LSM Tree (Multiple Location Read)

```java
LSMTree<Integer, String> lsm = new LSMTree<>(100);
// Load data... (creates multiple SSTables)

long start = System.nanoTime();
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    int key = random.nextInt(10000);
    String value = lsm.get(key);  // Check MemTable + all SSTables
    // Must check MemTable (O(log M))
    // Then check SSTable-5 (O(log S))
    // Then check SSTable-4 (O(log S))
    // ... continue until found
}
long duration = System.nanoTime() - start;
```

**Analysis:**

- Time: O(log M + K * log S) where K = number of SSTables
- For 1,000 reads with 10 SSTables: ~1,000 * (10 * log(1000)) = ~100,000 operations
- Read amplification: High (must check multiple locations)

#### Performance Comparison

| SSTable Count | B+Tree (O(log N)) | LSM Tree (O(K * log S)) | B+Tree Advantage |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| K = 1         | ~13 ops/read      | ~13 ops/read            | ~1x (equal)      |
| K = 5         | ~13 ops/read      | ~65 ops/read            | 5x faster        |
| K = 10        | ~13 ops/read      | ~130 ops/read           | 10x faster       |

**Your calculation:** With 20 SSTables, B+Tree is approximately _____ times faster for reads.

**Key insight:** This is why LSM Trees need **compaction** - to reduce SSTable count!

## Case Studies: Storage Engines in the Wild

### MySQL (InnoDB): The B+Tree Workhorse

- **Engine:** InnoDB, the default storage engine for MySQL.
- **Pattern:** B+Tree.
- **How it works:** InnoDB uses a B+Tree for its primary key index, which is a **clustered index**. This means the table
  data itself is stored in the leaf nodes of the B+Tree, physically ordered by the primary key. This makes primary key
  lookups and range scans extremely fast.
- **Key Takeaway:** B+Trees are the default choice for general-purpose OLTP databases like MySQL that require strong
  consistency, fast point lookups, and efficient range queries (e.g., fetching users in a specific ID range). The
  trade-off is higher write amplification, as in-place updates can cause page splits.

### Apache Cassandra: LSM Trees for Write-Heavy Scale

- **Engine:** Apache Cassandra.
- **Pattern:** Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM Tree).
- **How it works:** Writes are first appended to a commit log and then written to an in-memory `memtable`. When the
  `memtable` is full, it's flushed to disk as an immutable `SSTable`. Reads must check the `memtable` and potentially
  multiple `SSTables`. Compaction processes merge `SSTables` in the background to improve read performance.
- **Key Takeaway:** Cassandra is built for massive write throughput and high availability. By turning random writes into
  sequential appends, LSM Trees are perfect for write-heavy workloads like time-series data, IoT metrics, and logging
  systems, at the cost of higher read latency and eventual consistency.

### RocksDB: The Embedded LSM Engine

- **Engine:** RocksDB, an embeddable key-value store developed by Facebook.
- **Pattern:** LSM Tree.
- **How it works:** RocksDB provides an LSM-based storage engine library that other databases can build on top of. It
  manages `memtables`, `SSTables`, and compaction, offering tunable performance for different workloads.
- **Key Takeaway:** The LSM Tree pattern is so powerful that it's used as a foundational component in many modern
  distributed databases like CockroachDB, TiDB, and YugabyteDB. It provides a robust, high-performance engine for
  handling state in a distributed environment.

### Part 3: Benchmark Comparison

**Your task:** Compare B+Tree vs LSM Tree performance.

```java
public class StorageBenchmark {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("=== Storage Engine Benchmark ===\n");

        benchmarkWrites();
        System.out.println();

        System.out.printf("LSM is %.2fx faster for writes%n",
            (double)btreeTime/lsmTime);
    }

    static void benchmarkReads() {
        System.out.println("--- Read Performance ---");
        int numEntries = 10000;

            lsm.get(key);
        }
        long lsmTime = System.nanoTime() - start;

        System.out.printf("B+Tree: %.2f ms (%.0f reads/sec)%n",

        // TODO: Implement mixed workload benchmark
        // Interleave reads and writes
        // Compare performance

        System.out.println("TODO: Implement this benchmark");
    }
}
```

**Must complete:**

- [ ] Implement B+Tree insert, search, rangeQuery
- [ ] Implement LSM Tree put, get, flush, compact
- [ ] Run both client programs successfully

## Debugging Challenges

**Your task:** Find and fix bugs in broken storage engine implementations. This tests your deep understanding.

### Challenge 1: Broken B+Tree Leaf Split

```java
/**
 * This splitLeaf method is supposed to split a full leaf node.
 * It has 3 CRITICAL BUGS. Find them!
 */
private void splitLeaf(LeafNode leaf) {
    LeafNode newLeaf = new LeafNode();
    int midpoint = leaf.keys.size() / 2;

    // Move half the keys/values to new leaf
    for (int i = midpoint; i < leaf.keys.size(); i++) {
        newLeaf.keys.add(leaf.keys.get(i));
        newLeaf.values.add(leaf.values.get(i));
    }

    for (int i = midpoint; i < leaf.keys.size(); i++) {
        leaf.keys.remove(i);
        leaf.values.remove(i);
    }

    // newLeaf.next = ???

    InternalNode parent = (InternalNode) leaf.parent;
    parent.keys.add(newLeaf.keys.get(0));
    parent.children.add(newLeaf);
}
```

**Your debugging:**

- Bug 1: <span class="fill-in">[What's the bug?]</span>
- Bug 2: <span class="fill-in">[What's the bug?]</span>
- Bug 3: <span class="fill-in">[What's the bug?]</span>

<details markdown>
<summary>Click to verify your answers</summary>

**Bug 1 (Lines 13-16):** Removing elements while iterating forward breaks indices. Each removal shifts remaining
elements left.

**Fix:**

```java
// Remove from end to avoid index shifting
for (int i = leaf.keys.size() - 1; i >= midpoint; i--) {
    leaf.keys.remove(i);
    leaf.values.remove(i);
}
// OR use subList:
leaf.keys.subList(midpoint, leaf.keys.size()).clear();
leaf.values.subList(midpoint, leaf.values.size()).clear();
```

**Bug 2 (After line 11):** Must link new leaf into the leaf chain for range queries!

**Fix:**

```java
newLeaf.next = leaf.next;  // New leaf points to old leaf's next
leaf.next = newLeaf;       // Old leaf points to new leaf
```

**Bug 3 (Lines 22-23):** If leaf is root, parent is null - NullPointerException!

**Fix:**

```java
if (leaf.parent == null) {
    // Create new root
    InternalNode newRoot = new InternalNode();
    newRoot.keys.add(newLeaf.keys.get(0));
    newRoot.children.add(leaf);
    newRoot.children.add(newLeaf);
    leaf.parent = newRoot;
    newLeaf.parent = newRoot;
    root = newRoot;
} else {
    InternalNode parent = (InternalNode) leaf.parent;
    // Insert key in sorted position (not just add!)
    // Insert newLeaf in corresponding position
}
```

### Challenge 2: Broken LSM Tree Compaction

```java
/**
 * Compact all SSTables into one.
 * This has 2 LOGIC BUGS that cause data loss and incorrect ordering.
 */
public void compact() {
    if (sstables.size() <= 1) return;

    TreeMap<K, V> merged = new TreeMap<>();

    for (int i = sstables.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        SSTable<K, V> table = sstables.get(i);
        for (Map.Entry<K, V> entry : table.entrySet()) {
            merged.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
        }
    }

    // Create compacted SSTable
    SSTable<K, V> compacted = new SSTable<>(merged);

    sstables.add(compacted);

    System.out.println("Compacted into 1 SSTable");
}
```

**Your debugging:**

- Bug 1: <span class="fill-in">[What's the bug?]</span>
- Bug 2: <span class="fill-in">[What's the bug?]</span>

<details markdown>
<summary>Click to verify your answers</summary>

**Bug 1 (Line 9):** Iterating from newest to oldest means older values overwrite newer ones!

LSM Trees must keep the NEWEST value for each key. By iterating newest-to-oldest and using `put()`, when we encounter
the key again in an older SSTable, it overwrites the newer value.

**Fix:**

```java
// Iterate from OLDEST to NEWEST
for (int i = 0; i < sstables.size(); i++) {
    SSTable<K, V> table = sstables.get(i);
    for (Map.Entry<K, V> entry : table.entrySet()) {
        merged.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());  // Later puts overwrite earlier
    }
}
```

**Bug 2 (Line 18):** We add the compacted SSTable but never remove the old ones! Memory leak!

**Fix:**

```java
sstables.clear();          // Remove all old SSTables
sstables.add(compacted);   // Add compacted one
```

### Challenge 3: B+Tree Search with Wrong Child Selection

```java
/**
 * Find the leaf node where key should be located.
 * This has 1 SUBTLE BUG in binary search logic.
 */
private LeafNode findLeaf(K key) {
    Node current = root;

    while (!current.isLeaf()) {
        InternalNode internal = (InternalNode) current;

        int i = 0;
        while (i < internal.keys.size() && key.compareTo(internal.keys.get(i)) > 0) {
            i++;
        }

        current = internal.children.get(i);
    }

    return (LeafNode) current;
}
```

**Your debugging:**

- Bug: <span class="fill-in">[What's the bug?]</span>

**Trace through manually:**

```
Internal node: keys=[20], children=[ChildA, ChildB]
ChildA contains: [10, 15]
ChildB contains: [20, 25, 30]

Search key=20:

- Line 12: i=0, key(20) > keys[0](20)? NO
- i stays 0
- Visit children[0] = ChildA
- BUG: Key 20 is actually in ChildB!
```

<details markdown>
<summary>Click to verify your answer</summary>

**Bug (Line 12):** Using `>` instead of `>=` causes keys equal to split points to go left when they should go right.

**B+Tree invariant:** Internal node key K means "left child < K, right child >= K"

**Fix:**

```java
while (i < internal.keys.size() && key.compareTo(internal.keys.get(i)) >= 0) {
    i++;
}
```

OR be more explicit:

```java
int i;
for (i = 0; i < internal.keys.size(); i++) {
    if (key.compareTo(internal.keys.get(i)) < 0) {
        break;
    }
}
current = internal.children.get(i);
```

</details>

### Challenge 4: LSM Tree Missing Flush

```java
/**
 * This LSM Tree mysteriously loses data after many inserts.
 * Find the CRITICAL MISSING OPERATION.
 */
public class LSMTree<K extends Comparable<K>, V> {
    private TreeMap<K, V> memTable;
    private List<SSTable<K, V>> sstables;
    private final int memTableSize = 100;

    public void put(K key, V value) {
        memTable.put(key, value);

        if (memTable.size() >= memTableSize) {
            flush();
        }
    }

    private void flush() {
        SSTable<K, V> newTable = new SSTable<>(memTable);
        sstables.add(newTable);
        System.out.println("Flushed to SSTable");
    }
}
```

**Your debugging:**

- Bug: <span class="fill-in">[What's the bug?]</span>

<details markdown>
<summary>Click to verify your answer</summary>

**Bug (After line 20):** We never clear the MemTable after flushing!

**Result:** MemTable keeps growing forever. After first flush, memTable has 100 items. After second flush, it has 200.
Eventually OutOfMemoryError.

**Also:** Data gets duplicated across SSTables because we keep the same data in memory and keep flushing it again.

**Fix:**

```java
private void flush() {
    SSTable<K, V> newTable = new SSTable<>(memTable);
    sstables.add(newTable);
    memTable.clear();  // CRITICAL: Clear for new writes!
    System.out.println("Flushed to SSTable");
}
```

OR initialize a new MemTable:

```java
memTable = new TreeMap<>();
```

</details>

---

### Challenge 5: Range Query Doesn't Stop

```java
/**
 * B+Tree range query implementation.
 * This has 1 CRITICAL BUG causing incorrect results.
 */
public List<V> rangeQuery(K startKey, K endKey) {
    List<V> results = new ArrayList<>();

    LeafNode leaf = findLeaf(startKey);

    // Traverse leaves until we exceed endKey
    while (leaf != null) {
        for (int i = 0; i < leaf.keys.size(); i++) {
            K key = leaf.keys.get(i);

            if (key.compareTo(startKey) >= 0) {
                results.add(leaf.values.get(i));
            }
        }

        leaf = leaf.next;
    }

    return results;
}
```

**Your debugging:**

- Bug: <span class="fill-in">[What's the bug?]</span>

<details markdown>
<summary>Click to verify your answer</summary>

**Bug (Lines 11-17):** We check if key >= startKey but never check if key > endKey!

**Result:** Range query returns ALL keys from startKey to the end of the tree, ignoring endKey.

**Fix:**

```java
while (leaf != null) {
    for (int i = 0; i < leaf.keys.size(); i++) {
        K key = leaf.keys.get(i);

        if (key.compareTo(endKey) > 0) {
            return results;  // Stop when we exceed endKey
        }

        if (key.compareTo(startKey) >= 0) {
            results.add(leaf.values.get(i));
        }
    }

    leaf = leaf.next;
}
```

**Optimization:** Can also break out of outer loop:

```java
if (key.compareTo(endKey) > 0) {
    break;  // Exit inner loop
}
// After inner loop:
if (leaf.keys.size() > 0 &&
    leaf.keys.get(leaf.keys.size()-1).compareTo(endKey) > 0) {
    break;  // Exit outer loop
}
```

## Practice

### Scenario 1: Social Media Posts Table

Design storage for this table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT,
    content TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    likes_count INT
);
```

**Queries:**

- Q1: Get recent posts by user (sorted by created_at)
- Q2: Get top posts by likes in last 24 hours
- Q3: Insert new posts (10,000 posts/sec)

**Your design:**

Design storage for metrics data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE metrics (
    metric_name VARCHAR(100),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    value DOUBLE,
    tags JSONB
);
```

**Access patterns:**

- Writes: 1M data points/second

# APPENDIX: The Historical Evolution - From First Principles

> **Why this appendix exists**: The main chapter teaches B+Trees and LSM Trees side-by-side. But historically, B+Trees
> came first and dominated for 30 years. Understanding this evolution provides deeper intuition about why these designs
> exist.

---

## The Historical Truth

**1970s-2000s**: If you said "database storage engine," you meant **B+Tree**.

- Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server - all B+Trees
- Learned in every databases class
- The default, the standard, the only choice

**2006**: Google's BigTable paper changes everything

- Describes LSM-style architecture for web-scale writes
- Solves write amplification problem in B+Trees

**2008-2012**: NoSQL movement adopts LSM Trees

- Cassandra, HBase, RocksDB, LevelDB
- Narrative: "B+Trees are old SQL. LSM Trees are modern NoSQL."

**Reality**: Both solve the same problem (organizing data on disk) with different trade-offs.

---

## The Evolution: Starting from Absolute Zero

Let's trace the path that led to these designs, starting from the simplest possible database.

**How to use this section:** At each level, **try to predict what will break** before reading ahead. This builds the
intuition for why each innovation was necessary.

### Level 0: Unsorted Append-Only File (Heap File)

<div class="learner-section" markdown>

**⚠️ STOP: Before reading the code below, predict the problem:**

You're building the simplest possible database. You decide to just append every write to a file.

**Prediction Challenge:**

1. What operation will become slow as the database grows? <span class="fill-in">[Reads/Writes/Both?]</span>
2. Why? <span class="fill-in">[Your reasoning]</span>
3. At what scale does it become unbearable? <span class="fill-in">[100 records? 1M records?]</span>

<details markdown>
<summary>Check your prediction</summary>

**Answer**: Reads become O(N) - must scan entire file for every lookup.

**Math**: With 1M records at 1 microsecond per comparison:

- Average search time: 500,000 comparisons = **500ms** 🐌
- This is unacceptable for any interactive application (target: <100ms)

</details>

</div>

```java
// The simplest possible database
public class SimpleDB {
    File dataFile;

    public void insert(K key, V value) {
        dataFile.append(key + "," + value + "\n");  // O(1) - Fast! ✓
    }

    public V search(K key) {
        for (String line : dataFile.readAllLines()) {  // O(N) - Slow! ✗
            if (line.startsWith(key)) {
                return parseValue(line);
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

**Characteristics**:

- ✅ Writes: O(1) - just append
- ✅ Simple to implement
- ❌ Reads: O(N) - must scan entire file
- ❌ Updates: O(N) - must scan to find, then append new version

**Problem**: With 1 million records, every search reads 1 million lines. Unbearable.

### Level 1: Sorted File

<div class="learner-section" markdown>

**⚠️ STOP: Before reading the code below, predict the problem:**

We fixed reads by keeping the file sorted (enabling binary search). But what's the cost?

**Prediction Challenge:**

1. How does insert performance change? <span class="fill-in">[Better/Worse/Same?]</span>
2. Why? <span class="fill-in">[What must happen to maintain sorted order?]</span>
3. For 1M records, what's the average cost of one insert? <span class="fill-in">[How many records moved?]</span>

<details markdown>
<summary>Check your prediction</summary>

**Answer**: Inserts become O(N) - must shift data to maintain sorted order.

**Math**: With 1M records:

- Binary search finds position: log₂(1M) = 20 comparisons (fast)
- Shift half the file on average: 500,000 records moved
- Each record = 100 bytes → **50MB rewritten per insert** 🐌
- This is worse than the unsorted file!

**Trade-off discovered**: Optimizing reads (sorting) made writes slower.

</details>

</div>

```java
// Keep file sorted by key - enables binary search
public class SortedFileDB {
    File sortedFile;  // Maintained in sorted order by key

    public void insert(K key, V value) {
        // 1. Binary search to find position: O(log N)
        int position = binarySearchFile(key);

        // 2. Shift everything after position right: O(N) ✗
        shiftDataRight(position);

        // 3. Insert new record
        writeAt(position, key, value);

        // Result: Must rewrite ~50% of file on average!
    }

    public V search(K key) {
        // Binary search through file: O(log N) ✓
        return binarySearchFile(key);
    }
}
```

**Characteristics**:

- ✅ Reads: O(log N) - binary search
- ❌ Writes: O(N) - must shift data to maintain sort order
- ❌ Every insert rewrites half the file on average

**Problem**: Writes went from O(1) to O(N). Optimization for reads broke writes.

### Level 2: Binary Search Tree (BST) - In-Memory

<div class="learner-section" markdown>

**⚠️ STOP: Before reading the code below, predict the problem:**

Binary Search Trees (BST) give us O(log N) for both reads and writes. Perfect! But what happens when we put this on
disk?

**Prediction Challenge:**

1. How many disk seeks are needed to search a BST with 1M
   records? <span class="fill-in">[Hint: What's the tree height?]</span>
2. If each disk seek takes 10ms, how long does one search take? <span class="fill-in">[Calculate total time]</span>
3. What's inefficient about storing each BST node on disk? <span class="fill-in">[Think about disk page sizes]</span>

<details markdown>
<summary>Check your prediction</summary>

**Answer**: BST creates a TALL tree with TINY nodes - terrible for disk I/O.

**Math**: With 1M records:

- Tree height: log₂(1M) ≈ 20 levels
- Each level = 1 disk seek
- Disk seek time: ~10ms
- **Total: 20 × 10ms = 200ms per query** 🐌

**Inefficiency**:

- BST node size: ~32 bytes (2 pointers + key + value)
- Disk page size: 4KB
- **Wasting 99% of each disk read!**

**Problem discovered**: We need to pack more data per disk read to minimize seeks.

</details>

</div>

```java
class Node {
    K key;
    V value;
    Node left;   // Pointer to left child
    Node right;  // Pointer to right child
}

public class BSTDB {
    Node root;

    public void insert(K key, V value) {
        root = insertRec(root, key, value);  // O(log N) average ✓
    }

    public V search(K key) {
        return searchRec(root, key);  // O(log N) average ✓
    }
}
```

**Looks great! Both reads and writes are O(log N).**

**But... when you put this on disk:**

**Problem 1: Each node is tiny**

- Node size: 2 pointers (16 bytes) + key (8 bytes) + value (8 bytes) = ~32 bytes
- Disk page size: 4KB
- Wasting 99% of each disk read!

**Problem 2: Tree is TALL**

- For 1M records: height = log₂(1M) ≈ 20 levels
- Each level = 1 disk seek
- Disk seek time on HDD: ~10ms
- **Total: 20 seeks × 10ms = 200ms per query** 🐌

**Problem 3: Can become unbalanced**

- If inserts are sorted: tree becomes linked list
- O(log N) becomes O(N) worst case

---

### Level 3: B-Tree (1972) - The Breakthrough

**Key insight**: Disk I/O is expensive. **Minimize disk seeks** by making nodes match disk page size.

```java
class BTreeNode {
    List<K> keys;        // 100-1000 keys per node (depending on key size)
    List<Node> children; // 101-1001 children

    // Each node fits in one disk page (4KB)
}
```

**Why this is revolutionary**:

```
Binary Search Tree (1M records):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Node size: 32 bytes             │
│ Height: log₂(1,000,000) ≈ 20    │
│ Disk seeks per query: 20        │
│ Query time: 20 × 10ms = 200ms ❌ │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

B-Tree with order 100 (1M records):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Node size: 4KB (one disk page)  │
│ Keys per node: ~100             │
│ Height: log₁₀₀(1,000,000) ≈ 3   │
│ Disk seeks per query: 3         │
│ Query time: 3 × 10ms = 30ms ✓   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Result: 6-7x faster!
```

**The key insight**: Each disk read should fetch as much useful data as possible. Wide nodes = short tree = fewer seeks.

**B-Tree characteristics**:

- ✅ Reads: O(log N) with minimal disk seeks
- ✅ Writes: O(log N) with in-place updates
- ✅ Self-balancing
- ⚠️ Data scattered throughout tree (internal + leaf nodes)

---

### Level 4: B+Tree - Optimized for Range Queries

**Problem with B-Tree**: Range queries are awkward.

```java
// Range query in B-Tree
public List<V> rangeQuery(K start, K end) {
    List<V> results = new ArrayList<>();

    // Problem: Data is scattered throughout the tree
    // Must do tree traversal for EACH key in range
    // Jumps around different levels - inefficient!

    for (K key = start; key <= end; key++) {
        results.add(search(key));  // Each search = tree traversal
    }
    return results;
}
```

**B+Tree solution**:

1. **All data in leaf nodes only** (internal nodes = just keys for navigation)
2. **Link leaf nodes together** (sequential list)

```java
class LeafNode {
    List<K> keys;
    List<V> values;
    LeafNode next;  // ← The magic pointer
}

public List<V> rangeQuery(K start, K end) {
    LeafNode leaf = findLeaf(start);  // O(log N) to find start

    List<V> results = new ArrayList<>();
    while (leaf != null) {
        for (int i = 0; i < leaf.keys.size(); i++) {
            K key = leaf.keys.get(i);
            if (key > end) return results;  // Done
            if (key >= start) results.add(leaf.values.get(i));
        }
        leaf = leaf.next;  // ← Sequential! Fast!
    }
    return results;
}
```

**Result**: Range queries are **sequential** after finding the start point. Perfect for databases.

**B+Trees dominated databases for 30+ years (1972-2000s).** Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server - all B+Trees.

## The Problem That Necessitated LSM Trees

### The Google Problem (mid-2000s)

**Workload**: Indexing the web for Google Search

- **Write volume**: Billions of page updates per day
- **Write pattern**: Mostly inserts (new pages discovered)
- **Read pattern**: Batch processing MapReduce jobs (can tolerate some latency)

**B+Tree performance breakdown**:

```java
// Every insert in B+Tree requires:
public void insert(K key, V value) {
    // 1. Read root page from disk (4KB)
    // 2. Read internal node from disk (4KB)
    // 3. Read leaf page from disk (4KB)
    // 4. Modify leaf (change maybe 100 bytes of data)
    // 5. Write entire leaf page back to disk (4KB) ← WRITE AMPLIFICATION!
    // 6. If leaf is full, split it:
    //    - Create new leaf page (4KB write)
    //    - Update parent pointer (4KB read + 4KB write)
    // 7. May cascade up the tree

    // Result: 1 logical write (100 bytes)
    //       = 5-10 physical I/O operations (20-40KB)
    //       = 200-400x write amplification!
}
```

**The math that broke B+Trees**:

- 1 billion inserts per day
- 40KB average I/O per insert (due to write amplification)
- **= 40TB of disk I/O per day**
- Actual new data: **~100GB**
- **Write amplification: 400x**

**Additional problem**:

- B+Trees do **random I/O** (tree traversal jumps around disk)
- On spinning disks: random I/O = **100x slower** than sequential I/O
- Random seeks kill throughput

---

## First Principles → LSM Tree

**Question**: How can we optimize for massive write volume?

### Core Insight: Delay Sorting

```
When do you pay the cost of sorting?
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│                                 │
│      On Every Write             │
│         (B+Tree)                │
│           vs                    │
│      In Batches                 │
│       (LSM Tree)                │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**B+Tree philosophy**: Keep data sorted all the time

- Insert cost: O(log N) - must maintain sort order immediately
- Read cost: O(log N) - data is always sorted

**LSM Tree philosophy**: Sort in batches, not per-write

- Insert cost: O(log M) - just update in-memory buffer (M << N)
- Read cost: O(K × log S) - check multiple sorted files
- Amortize sorting cost over many writes

---

### The LSM Tree Evolution

**Step 1: Recognize append-only is fastest**

```java
// Fastest possible write: append to log
public void write(K key, V value) {
    log.append(key + "," + value);  // O(1), sequential I/O ✓
}

// But reads are O(N) - scan entire log ✗
```

---

**Step 2: Buffer writes in memory (sorted)**

```java
TreeMap<K, V> memTable = new TreeMap<>();  // Sorted in memory

public void write(K key, V value) {
    memTable.put(key, value);  // O(log M) where M is small (e.g., 10K)
    // Fast! In-memory operation, no disk I/O
}

public V read(K key) {
    return memTable.get(key);  // O(log M)
}
```

**Benefit**: Writes are fast (in-memory), data is sorted.

**Problem**: Limited by RAM size. Need to flush to disk eventually.

---

**Step 3: Flush to sorted files periodically**

```java
public void write(K key, V value) {
    memTable.put(key, value);

    if (memTable.size() >= threshold) {
        // Flush to disk as sorted file (SSTable)
        SSTable newTable = writeSSTable(memTable);  // Sequential write - FAST!
        sstables.add(newTable);
        memTable.clear();
    }
}
```

**Benefit**:

- Batched writes: 1000 inserts → 1 sequential flush
- **100-1000x less I/O** than B+Tree
- Sequential writes (fast on HDDs)

---

**Step 4: Read from multiple locations**

```java
public V read(K key) {
    // Check memory first (most recent)
    if (memTable.containsKey(key)) {
        return memTable.get(key);
    }

    // Check on-disk files (newest to oldest)
    for (int i = sstables.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        SSTable table = sstables.get(i);
        V value = table.get(key);  // Binary search in sorted file
        if (value != null) return value;
    }

    return null;  // Not found
}
```

**Trade-off**:

- ❌ Reads are slower (check multiple places)
- ✅ But acceptable for **write-heavy** workloads

**This is called "read amplification"**: must check K files instead of 1 tree.

---

**Step 5: Compact periodically**

```java
// Problem: Too many SSTables → slow reads
// Solution: Merge files periodically

public void compact() {
    TreeMap<K, V> merged = new TreeMap<>();

    // Merge all SSTables (oldest to newest)
    for (SSTable table : sstables) {
        for (Entry<K, V> entry : table.entrySet()) {
            merged.put(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());
            // Newer values overwrite older ones
        }
    }

    // Replace old SSTables with one compacted file
    sstables.clear();
    sstables.add(new SSTable(merged));
}
```

**Result**: Fewer files = faster reads. Amortize compaction cost over time.

---

## Where WAL (Write-Ahead Log) Fits

**WAL is orthogonal** to your storage engine choice. It's about **durability**, not structure.

**Problem**: MemTable is in RAM - what if crash before flush?

```java
// Without WAL: Data lost on crash ❌
public void put(K key, V value) {
    memTable.put(key, value);  // If crash here, data is LOST!

    if (memTable.size() >= threshold) {
        flushToSSTable(memTable);
    }
}
```

**Solution: WAL (Write-Ahead Log)**

```java
// With WAL: Durable ✓
public void put(K key, V value) {
    // 1. Write to WAL FIRST (append-only log on disk)
    wal.append(key, value);      // Persist to disk immediately

    // 2. Update in-memory MemTable
    memTable.put(key, value);    // Fast in-memory update

    if (memTable.size() >= threshold) {
        flushToSSTable(memTable);
        wal.clear();  // Can delete WAL after successful flush
    }
}

// On crash recovery:
public void recover() {
    memTable = replayWAL();  // Rebuild MemTable from WAL
    // Then continue normal operations
}
```

**WAL characteristics**:

- Append-only (sequential writes - fast)
- Only stores recent uncommitted data
- Deleted after flush
- Used for crash recovery

**Both B+Trees and LSM Trees use WAL** for durability. It's a separate layer from the core storage structure.

---

## In-Memory Storage Engines (Redis, Memcached)

**Completely different trade-off**: RAM vs Disk

### Redis (Pure In-Memory)

```java
// Everything in RAM - no disk I/O for reads!
Map<K, V> data = new HashMap<>();

public void put(K key, V value) {
    data.put(key, value);  // O(1) - instant! ⚡
}

public V get(K key) {
    return data.get(key);  // O(1) - instant! ⚡
}

// Optional: Persist to disk asynchronously (doesn't block)
public void backgroundSave() {
    fork();  // Copy-on-write
    childProcess.writeToDisk(data);  // Snapshot
}
```

**Advantages**:

- ⚡ Extremely fast: O(1) for hash operations
- No disk I/O latency (microseconds vs milliseconds)
- Simple architecture

**Disadvantages**:

- 💰 RAM is 30-50x more expensive than SSD
- 📏 Limited capacity: can't store more than RAM
- ❌ Data loss risk: if crash before persistence
- ❌ No range queries (hash table, not sorted)

**When to use**:

- **Cache** (can rebuild from database if lost)
- **Session storage** (acceptable to lose some sessions)
- **Real-time counters** (like/view counts)
- **Leaderboards** (can reconstruct)
- **Pub/sub** (transient messages)

**When NOT to use**:

- ❌ Primary data store (too expensive, data loss risk)
- ❌ Large datasets (> available RAM)
- ❌ Requires durability guarantees

4. **In-memory engines** (Redis) are different trade-off entirely
    - RAM vs disk capacity
    - Speed vs durability
    - Use for caching, not primary storage

5. **No universal "best"**
    - B+Tree: read-heavy, range queries, OLTP
